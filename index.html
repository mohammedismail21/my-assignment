        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.  </p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Mission for Vision’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic aims to promote the health and safety of our staff, partners and communities engaging with our programmes and the wellbeing of the wider society. It aspires to minimise contagion and avert serious illness and mortality. Our guidance considers the Indian context and is based on Government advisory, expert opinion, public health assumptions and the value of physical distancing.</p>

        <h2>Vission</h2>
        <p>Purpose: To critically evaluate the potential impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on global ophthalmology and VISION 2020.

        Design: Perspective supplemented with epidemiologic insights from available online databases.
            
        Methods: We extracted data from the Global Vision Database (2017) and Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) to highlight temporal trends in global blindness since 1990, and provide a narrative overview of how COVID-19 may derail progress toward the goals of VISION 2020.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>As of 31 December 2020, COVID-19 had infected over 82 million people and killed more than 1.8 million worldwide. But preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global “excess deaths” directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19 in 2020 amount to at least 3 million, 1.2 million higher than the official figures reported by countries to WHO.</p>
